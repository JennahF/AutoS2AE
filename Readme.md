#4 This repository contains the code of paper AutoS$^2$AE: Automate to Regularize Sparse Shallow Autoencoders for Recommendation(WWW'23)

Algorithms realized in this repository are as follows:

1. alg/EWnLOPT_fast.m ----- AutoS2AE
2. alg/EASE.m -------- EASE
3. alg/iccf/ --------- WRMF

Use the following code to initialize:

> init

To run the code, please refer to run_baseline.m(Datasets should be prepared.) Use:

> run_baseline

to generate desired outputs.
(Datasets should be prepared in advance)
